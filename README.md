# Automatic Unit Test Generation with LLM

This repository provides a tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate unit tests. Our approach is based on the research outlined in the paper ["Automated Unit Test Generation using Large Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09171).

## Features

- Automatic generation of unit tests using LLMs
- Improved code coverage and test quality
- Seamless integration with existing codebases

## Getting Started

To get started with our tool, follow the instructions below:

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdirakhman/llm-pytest-gen.git
cd llm-pytest-gen
```
2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **Generate unit tests**
```bash
python main.py  PROJECT_PATH/test/TEST_FILE.py PROJECT_PATH FILE.py
```
## Demo
